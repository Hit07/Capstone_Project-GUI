# FLASH CARD CAPSTONE PROJECT



This repository contains a set of flashcards for learning French and Kannada words with their English translations. The flashcards are divided into two separate decks, one for French words and one for Kannada words.

The flashcards are in the form of text files, with each line containing one word and its translation separated by comma.The file for Kannada words follows the same format.

To use these flashcards, simply import them into your favorite flashcard application, such as Anki or Quizlet, and start practicing! You can also use these files as a reference for building your own flashcards or for studying French and Kannada vocabulary.

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you notice any errors or have suggestions for additional words to include, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

Happy Learning!!
